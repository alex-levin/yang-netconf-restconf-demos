27:06   RESTCONF is REST API version to consume YANG models. gRPC is Google RPC that we can use with YANG model.
27:24   DOES YOUR DEVICE SUPPORT NETCONF / RESTCONF / gRPC? - scroll down to this.
        Shows which platform, which software version is supported.
        If YANG is like MIB, NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC are like SNMP versions that are there.
        So, this chart cays these iOS XE have supported NETCOMP and here's the RFC 6241 supported.
        How can we use NETCONF to ask a device what models are supported?
29:00   https://github.com/YangModels/yang
        Here we can find IETF as well as vendor specific models from Cisco and many other vendors.

        ietf-interfaces.yang
29:58   https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor - vendor models are there
        https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco - Cisco models
        https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/xe - contains software versions - 16.10.1, 16.11.1, 16.12.1...
        https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/xe/1671 - clicked on 16.7.1
        Cisco-IOS-XE-aaa.yang - Cisco native model to describe triple A authentication that's there.
        It's easy to see which models are supported and then get access to them so that we can use a tool like pyang to actually
        inquire and navigate through them as they go through.
31:32   The Cisco IOS-XE YANG models are modularized. The top model we start with is Cisco-IOS-XE-native.yang. It imports other ones.
        It makes it easiter for software developers to manage models. Instead of updating a gigantic model,
        a software developer can update a model that is small and is imported (e.g. Cisco-IOS-XE-mpls.yang).
        The Cisco NX-OS (Nexus) team takes opposite approach. There is a sigle nxos native model that has everything in it:        
32:41   https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco/nx
        They are using CSR 1000v (Cisco CSR Virtual Routers) sandbox in all of their training labs.
33:30   Many things are available on their virtual platforms. No need to buy hardware on eBay.
        Go grab the sandbox with the CSR virtual version or Nexus 9000 virtual version.
        CSR 1000v is a great way to explore and learn about it.
34:20   Where does NETCONF fit into this? NETCONF is the transport protocol side of this. NETCONF has no idea what it interfaces with
        but it knows how to connect to a device securely. It knows how to authenticate, how to package a request and send a reuest to retrieve
        the information or send configuration details in there. NETCONF is a protocol we use to communicate with a device.
        NETCONF is one protoclo, RESTCONF is another protocol. NETCONF runs over the top of SSH. It leverages XML under the hood.
35:20   RESTCONF runs over HTTP and leverages REST API standards like headres and authentication. 
        Both NETCONF and RESTCONF leverage the exact YANG models that are there. If a device supports IETF interfaces model, we can
        communicate with the device over either NETCONF or RESTCONF and get access over the same details that are there.
35:55   NETCONF is better than SNMP because it's more secure - its's one of many benefits - because it leverages SSH.
36:55   RESTCONF is now standardized to use HTTPS (HTTP is no longer supported).
37:15   One would I use one over the other (NETCONF vs RESTCONF)? If the devices support both, it comes down to two factors:
        - Personal preference. A lot of people use RESTCONF because they prefere the REST API interaction. Personally, he is in the same bucket.
        - NETCONF was the first transport protocol that was stadardized. It is more mature. Most network devices don't support standard RESTCONF.
        We don't want to use RESTCONF if it is supported in draft (it can change).
        Device support is one of the reasons we cannot use RESTCONF.
        Another reason is RESTCONF and NETCONF from configuration operational perspective are pretty at parity. 
        If we want to configure an interface or get details on a protocol, we can do it using both NETCONF or RESTCONF.
        But when we start to look at some of the other types of use cases things like streaming telemetry when we want to subscribe to something
        or get details in some of those more advanced use cases around model-driven programmability, these use cases are not supported in RESTCONF.
39:20   Most people will start with RESTCONF if it is supported. If it is not supported, go to NETCONF.
        We have to learn NETCONF because it is supported on most of the devices today. if we are trying to use more advanced, we need to use
        NETCONF.
        Who will win? Application developers prefer RESTCONF, but network management software vendors (SolarWinds, Cisco) will probably
        prefer NETCONF because of some of the efficiency and capabilities.
40:50   gRPC by Google is emerging. Google wants a standard way to interface with devices in their data centers (a switch, a router, a server,
        a microservice). Most of the typical use cases for gRPC are not in typical configuration or operational queries.
        If we need to configure an interface, people are not using gRPC. What is the current statistics for a router? gRPC is not for this.
        Streaming telemetry or model driven telemetry - instead of polling the device every 5 secs or sending traps we are going 
        to setup kind of this connection between the collection system and the devices and we are going to stream the event 
        in nearly a real time to the collection system from the device. This is where gRPC is used today. That can change over time.

3.1.  Root Resource Discovery

   In line with the best practices defined by [RFC7320], RESTCONF
   enables deployments to specify where the RESTCONF API is located.
   When first connecting to a RESTCONF server, a RESTCONF client MUST
   determine the root of the RESTCONF API.  There MUST be exactly one
   "restconf" link relation returned by the device.

   The client discovers this by getting the "/.well-known/host-meta"
   resource ([RFC6415]) and using the <Link> element containing the
   "restconf" attribute:

   Example returning /restconf:

   The client might send the following:

      GET /.well-known/host-meta HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/xrd+xml

   The server might respond as follows:

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/xrd+xml
      Content-Length: nnn

Part 3
12:45   Let's look at the data model and how to map it into a specific URI
https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/master/standard/ietf/RFC/ietf-interfaces%402018-02-20.yang:
module ietf-interfaces {
    ...
    container interfaces {
        ...
        list interface {
              key "name";
            ...
            leaf name {
                    type string;
https://<ADDRESS>/restconf/data/ietf-interfaces:interface/interface=GigabitEthernet1?depth=unbound
ietf-interfaces is the name of the module we are interested in
:interface is the name of the container we are interested in that is specified inside of this module
/interface is a list object and we need a particular name (e.g. GigabitEthernet1)
13:35   depth=unbound is default (no need to specify it)

We need to come up with a yang model which returns a list of the discovered taclanes similar to this one which returns a list of the device interfaces:
